<p>One of the biggest reasons to use a package manager, is their powerful dependency management. Instead of manually having to make sure that you get all dependencies whenever you set up a project on a new computer, npm automatically installs everything for you. But how can npm know exactly what your project needs? Meet the <code>dependencies</code> section of your package.json file.</p>
<p>In this section, packages your project requires are stored using the following format:</p>
<pre class="language-json" tabindex="0"><code class="language-json">"dependencies": {
  "package-name": "version",
  "express": "4.14.0"
}

</code></pre>

<p>Add version "1.1.0" of the <code>@freecodecamp/example</code> package to the <code>dependencies</code> field of your <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>@freecodecamp/example</code> is a faux package used as a learning tool.</p>
