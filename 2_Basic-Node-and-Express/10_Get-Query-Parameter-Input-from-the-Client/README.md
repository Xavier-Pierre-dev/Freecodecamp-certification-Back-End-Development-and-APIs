<p>Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand (&amp;). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object <code>req.query</code>. Some characters, like the percent (%), cannot be in URLs and have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.</p>
<blockquote>route_path: '/library'<br/>actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&amp;bookId=6754' <br/>req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</blockquote>

<p>Build an API endpoint, mounted at <code>GET /name</code>. Respond with a JSON document, taking the structure <code>{ name: 'firstname lastname'}</code>. The first and last name parameters should be encoded in a query string e.g. <code>?first=firstname&amp;last=lastname</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the following exercise you are going to receive data from a POST request, at the same <code>/name</code> route path. If you want, you can use the method <code>app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler)</code>. This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route. You can save a bit of typing, and have cleaner code.</p>
