<p>Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a> and complete these challenges locally.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-express" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">our Replit starter project</a> to complete these challenges.</li>
<li>Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the <code>Solution Link</code> field.</p>
<p>During the development process, it is important to be able to check whatâ€™s going on in your code.</p>
<p>Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see console output in a terminal. On Replit, a terminal is open in the right pane by default.</p>
<p>We recommend to keep the terminal open while working at these challenges. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.</p>
